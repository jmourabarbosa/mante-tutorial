# mante-tutorial

Repo with all the materials for the RNN / Mante course in Nigeria. 

TODO:

* fine tune slides for Lecture one (in particular add explanation of TDR)
* fine tune tutorial (in particular merge current resources for training a network on the mante task in one working tutorial -> use colab to ensure compatibility!)
